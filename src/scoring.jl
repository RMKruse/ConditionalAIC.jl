    caic(m::LinearMixedModel; method=:auto, hessian=:analytic, nboot=nothing,
         sigmapenalty=1, rng=default_rng()) -> CAICResult

Score a fitted Gaussian linear mixed model by its **conditional AIC**

```math
\\mathrm{cAIC} = -2\\,\\ell_{\\mathrm{cond}}(y \\mid \\hat b, \\hat\\beta, \\hat\\theta) + 2\\rho,
```

the analogue of `cAIC4`'s `cAIC`. The conditional log-likelihood `ℓ_cond` is the Gaussian
density of `y` about the conditional fitted mean `ŷ = X β̂ + Z b̂`
([`condloglik`](@ref ConditionalAIC.Loglik.condloglik)); `ρ` is the bias-corrected effective degrees
of freedom, computed by the selected `method`. The mathematics follows the Greven–Kneib
correction for the bias term and the standard conditional log-likelihood.

The computation is performed on the fit *as given*, dispatching on `m.optsum.REML` (no
force-refit).

# Arguments
- `m`: a fitted Gaussian `LinearMixedModel`.
- `method`: the degrees-of-freedom method.
  - `:auto` (the default) resolves to `:steinian` for the Gaussian family — the analytic
    Greven–Kneib correction.
  - `:steinian` — the analytic Greven–Kneib bias correction.
  - `:bootstrap` — Efron's parametric-bootstrap covariance penalty; requires `nboot`.
- `hessian`: the Hessian **B**-source for `:steinian` — how the Greven–Kneib Hessian B is
  obtained. `:analytic` (the default) is the closed-form B. `:finitediff` self-drives finite
  differences; `:forwarddiff` rides the experimental `MixedModelsForwardDiffExt`. Ignored
  when `method = :bootstrap` (no Hessian B used; `bsource` is `:na` in the result).
- `nboot`: the number of parametric-bootstrap draws; required (and valid only) when
  `method = :bootstrap`.
- `sigmapenalty`: the number of estimated residual-variance parameters added to ρ — `1`
  (the default) for one estimated σ², `0` if the error variance is known.
- `rng`: an `AbstractRNG` for the bootstrap draws; defaults to `Random.default_rng()`.
  Pass a seeded `Xoshiro` (e.g. `rng=Xoshiro(42)`) for reproducibility.

# Returns
- A [`CAICResult`](@ref) carrying the cAIC, ρ (`dof`), the conditional log-likelihood, and
  provenance (the `method` and B-`source` actually used; `bsource = :na` for `:bootstrap`).

# Throws
- `ArgumentError` for an unknown `method`/`hessian`, a negative `sigmapenalty`, or `nboot`
  misuse (supplied without `method = :bootstrap`, or non-positive).

    caic(m::GeneralizedLinearMixedModel; method=:auto, nboot=nothing, rng=default_rng()) -> CAICResult

Score a fitted **generalized** linear mixed model by its **conditional AIC**

```math
\\mathrm{cAIC} = -2\\,\\ell_{\\mathrm{cond}}(y \\mid \\hat b, \\hat\\beta, \\hat\\theta) + 2\\rho.
```

The conditional log-likelihood `ℓ_cond` is the log-probability of `y` under the
conditional response distribution `f(μ̂)` (Poisson: [`condloglik_poisson`](@ref
ConditionalAIC.Loglik.condloglik_poisson); Bernoulli: [`condloglik_bernoulli`](@ref
ConditionalAIC.Loglik.condloglik_bernoulli); multi-trial Binomial: [`condloglik_binomial`](@ref
ConditionalAIC.Loglik.condloglik_binomial), which deviates from `cAIC4`'s defective binomial
conditional log-likelihood). The effective df `ρ` is estimated by the method
selected by `method`:

- **`:auto`** (the default) dispatches by family:
  - **Poisson** → Chen–Stein influence df ([`dof_glmm_poisson`](@ref
    ConditionalAIC.DofGLMM.dof_glmm_poisson)), the `cAIC4` `biasCorrectionPoisson` analogue.
  - **Bernoulli** → Efron's Steinian df ([`dof_glmm_bernoulli`](@ref
    ConditionalAIC.DofGLMM.dof_glmm_bernoulli)), the `cAIC4` `biasCorrectionBernoulli` analogue.
  - Other families: `ArgumentError` — use `method = :bootstrap`.
- **`:bootstrap`** → conditional bootstrap df ([`dof_glmm_bootstrap`](@ref
  ConditionalAIC.DofGLMM.dof_glmm_bootstrap)). Works for every bootstrap-supported family (Poisson,
  Bernoulli, multi-trial Binomial — the families `glmmconddraw` can simulate). `nboot` sets
  the draw count (default `max(n, 100)`).

**Full-singularity shortcut.** When every variance component is on the boundary (θ = 0),
the GLMM collapses to a plain GLM: `ρ = rank(X)` is returned directly with no refit,
mirroring `cAIC4`'s `deleteZeroComponents → zeroLessModel\$rank` in both
`biasCorrectionPoisson` and `biasCorrectionBernoulli`. The `method` kwarg has no effect
on this path.

# Arguments
- `m`: a fitted `GeneralizedLinearMixedModel`.
- `method`: df estimation method — `:auto` (default, family-dispatch) or `:bootstrap`.
- `nboot`: bootstrap draw count; valid only with `method = :bootstrap`; default
  `max(n, 100)` (matching `cAIC4::bcMer.R:54–56`).
- `rng`: random-number generator for the bootstrap draws; default `Random.default_rng()`.

# Returns
- A [`CAICResult`](@ref) carrying the cAIC, ρ (`dof`), the conditional log-likelihood,
  and provenance: `method` is the **resolved** estimator — `:auto` resolves to `:steinian`
  (the shared label for the family-dispatched analytic correction: Poisson Chen–Stein
  influence / Bernoulli Efron Steinian), and `:bootstrap` is recorded verbatim — and
  `bsource = :na` (GLMM paths carry no Hessian B-source).

# Throws
- `ArgumentError` for unsupported `method`, `nboot` misuse, or an unsupported family
  under `method = :auto`.

    caic(m::RegressionModel) -> CAICResult

Score a fixed-effects-only `GLM.jl` `lm`/`glm` fit — the **terminal node** a backward
[`stepcaic`](@ref) search reaches once the last random-effects term is dropped — by the same
conditional AIC `cAIC4` assigns its `(g)lm` branch:

```math
\\mathrm{cAIC} = -2\\,\\ell + 2\\,(\\mathrm{rank} + 1),
```

with `ℓ` the marginal (here = conditional, no random effects) log-likelihood of `y` under the
fitted family at the fitted mean μ̂, and the penalty `rank + 1` (the fixed-effect rank plus one
estimated dispersion/σ²). No Greven–Kneib / Steinian / bootstrap bias correction is involved —
the terminal is a deterministic closed form — so the result carries `method = :terminal` and
`bsource = :na`, and `reducedmodel = nothing` / `refit = false` (the terminal is never singular).

Supported terminals mirror the LMM/GLMM paths: the Gaussian `lm` (σ̂ the MLE rescaling
`summary(·)\$sigma·√((n−p)/n)`, i.e. `√(RSS/n)`), and the Poisson / Bernoulli / multi-trial
Binomial `glm`. The Binomial branch reuses [`condloglik_binomial`](@ref
ConditionalAIC.Loglik.condloglik_binomial) (the corrected density, deviating from `cAIC4`'s defective
multi-trial conditional log-likelihood); for the Bernoulli case it reduces to and matches
`cAIC4` exactly.

# Arguments

# Returns
