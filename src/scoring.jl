    caic(m::LinearMixedModel; method=:auto, hessian=:analytic, nboot=nothing, sigmapenalty=1)
        -> CAICResult

Score a fitted Gaussian linear mixed model by its **conditional AIC**

```math
\\mathrm{cAIC} = -2\\,\\ell_{\\mathrm{cond}}(y \\mid \\hat b, \\hat\\beta, \\hat\\theta) + 2\\rho,
```

the analogue of `cAIC4`'s `cAIC`. The conditional log-likelihood `ℓ_cond` is the Gaussian
density of `y` about the conditional fitted mean `ŷ = X β̂ + Z b̂`
([`condloglik`](@ref cAIC.Loglik.condloglik)); `ρ` is the Greven–Kneib bias-corrected
effective degrees of freedom ([`dof_lmm`](@ref cAIC.DofLMM.dof_lmm)), which exceeds the
naive plug-in `ρ₀ = tr(H₁)` because the variance parameters `θ` are estimated. The
mathematics is pinned in `docs/math/0002-gaussian-bias-correction.md` (the bias correction)
and `0003-conditional-loglik.md` (the log-likelihood).

The computation is performed on the fit *as given*, dispatching on `m.optsum.REML` (no
force-refit).

# Arguments
- `m`: a fitted Gaussian `LinearMixedModel`.
- `method`: the degrees-of-freedom method. `:auto` (the default) resolves to `:steinian`
  for the Gaussian family — the analytic Greven–Kneib correction. `:bootstrap` is parsed
  and validated but not yet implemented.
- `hessian`: the Hessian **B**-source — how the Greven–Kneib Hessian B is obtained.
  `:analytic` (the default) is the closed-form B, with no derivative dependency.
  `:finitediff` self-drives finite differences over `MixedModels`' stable objective;
  `:forwarddiff` rides the experimental `MixedModelsForwardDiffExt`. The numeric sources are
  three estimators of the same ρ that diverge as documented in `DECISIONS.md`
  (`:finitediff` reproduces `cAIC4`'s `analytic = FALSE`; `:forwarddiff` differs by holding
  σ̂² fixed). See `docs/math/0004-numeric-hessian-bsources.md` and ADR-0002.
- `nboot`: the number of bootstrap draws; valid only with `method = :bootstrap`.
- `sigmapenalty`: the number of estimated residual-variance parameters added to ρ — `1`
  (the default) for one estimated σ², `0` if the error variance is known.

# Returns
- A [`CAICResult`](@ref) carrying the cAIC, ρ (`dof`), the conditional log-likelihood, and
  provenance (the `method` and B-`source` actually used).

# Throws
- `ArgumentError` for an unknown `method`/`hessian`, a negative `sigmapenalty`, or `nboot`
  misuse (supplied without `method = :bootstrap`, or non-positive).
- An error stating the feature is *not yet implemented* for `method = :bootstrap`.

# Example
```jldoctest
julia> using MixedModels, cAIC

julia> m = fit(MixedModel, @formula(reaction ~ 1 + days + (1 + days | subj)),
               MixedModels.dataset(:sleepstudy); REML=false, progress=false);

julia> r = caic(m);

julia> r.caic ≈ -2 * r.condloglik + 2 * r.dof
true
