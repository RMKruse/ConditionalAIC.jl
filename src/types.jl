"""
    CAICResult{T<:AbstractFloat,M<:MixedModel}

The result of scoring a fitted mixed-effects model by its conditional AIC
(`cAIC = −2 ℓ_cond + 2 ρ`). Returned by [`caic`](@ref).

The fields are the public, typed accessors:

- `caic::T` — the conditional AIC value.
- `dof::T` — the bias-corrected effective degrees of freedom ρ (the penalty term).
- `condloglik::T` — the conditional log-likelihood ℓ(y | b̂, β̂, θ̂) (the `cAIC4`
  `getcondLL` quantity).
- `reducedmodel::Union{Nothing,M}` — the reduced model a singular fit was scored on, or
  `nothing` when the fit was non-singular and scored as given.
- `refit::Bool` — whether scoring was performed on a refitted reduced model.
- `method::Symbol` — the degrees-of-freedom **method** actually used (provenance), e.g.
  `:steinian`.
- `bsource::Symbol` — the Hessian **B-source** actually used (provenance), e.g.
  `:analytic`.

`method`/`bsource` record what was *resolved and run* (e.g. `method = :auto` resolves to
`:steinian` for the Gaussian family), so candidates can be checked for consistent scoring.

"""
    AnocaicTable{T<:AbstractFloat,M<:MixedModel}

The result of comparing a user-supplied set of fitted models by conditional AIC
(port of `cAIC4`'s `anocAIC`). Returned by [`anocaic`](@ref).

Models are sorted ascending by `cAIC` — entry `1` is the best-fitting model (lowest cAIC).

- `results::Vector{CAICResult{T,M}}` — per-model scoring results, sorted ascending by
  `cAIC` (best first). Each [`CAICResult`](@ref) carries the `cAIC`, effective degrees of
  freedom `ρ` (`dof`), conditional log-likelihood, and scoring provenance.
- `inputorder::Vector{Int}` — original 1-based position of each result in the argument
  list passed to `anocaic`. `inputorder[k]` is the input-list index of the k-th ranked
  model.

The Δcaic for rank `k` is `results[k].caic - results[1].caic` (≥ 0 for all `k`).
