**Quarantine module — the single, auditable touchpoint for `MixedModels.jl` internals.**

*All* access to `MixedModels.jl` internal fields and unexported functions lives here
and nowhere else. This module performs **no** translation or abstraction; it reaches
into the fitted-model object directly and exists solely to make every internal
touchpoint auditable in one place. Each accessor shape-asserts what it extracts so a
silent upstream change surfaces as a clear error rather than a wrong number downstream.

# Internal-access table

Pinned against **`MixedModels = "=5.5.1"`**. On a version bump, walking this table is the
required checklist; accessing an internal not listed here is forbidden — add the row
first.

**Experimental surface (ADR-0002).** `ForwardDiff.hessian(::LinearMixedModel)` (the
`MixedModelsForwardDiffExt` extension, used by [`bhessian`]) is the one touchpoint on
`MixedModels`' *experimental* AD surface; the docs warn that which parameters are
differentiated alongside θ may change, which would silently alter B's dimension, so
[`bhessian`] shape-asserts the `s×s` result against the `=5.5.1` pin. The companion
`FiniteDiff.finite_difference_hessian(::LinearMixedModel)` extension is **deliberately not
accessed** — the `:finitediff` source self-drives `FiniteDiff` over the stable
`objective!`/`setθ!`/`updateL!` trio instead (ADR-0002).

Perform **one** structural reduction of a boundary (singular) fit: drop every
random-effect direction whose relative-covariance diagonal `λ[d, d]` is zero, then refit
the resulting reduced model. This is the `MixedModels.jl` analogue of one level of
`cAIC4`'s `deleteZeroComponents` — the columns on the boundary are removed and the model
is re-estimated on the surviving random-effects structure.

Per reterm the surviving directions are `keep = {d : λ[d, d] ≠ 0}`:
- a *partial* drop (some but not all directions kept) column-subsets the `ReMat`
  (e.g. `(1 + x | g)` with a boundary slope → `(1 + x | g)` reduced to the intercept);
- a reterm with no surviving direction is dropped whole (e.g. `(1 | g₁) + (1 | g₂)` with
  `g₂` on the boundary → `(1 | g₁)`).

Each surviving reterm is rebuilt **fresh** (reusing the stored grouping `trm`/`refs`/
`levels` and the kept design rows, with `λ` reset to the identity for re-estimation), so
the returned model shares no mutable state with `m`. The fixed-effects term and formula
are reused; refitting uses the reterms and feterm, not the (now stale) formula, so the
reduced fit matches a native fit of the reduced model. The reduction may itself land on
the boundary — the caller iterates ([`caic`](@ref) cascades until non-singular).

Returns the refitted reduced [`LinearMixedModel`](@ref), or `nothing` when **every**
random-effect direction is on the boundary (no random-effects model remains — the caller
falls back to the fixed-effects-only score, mirroring `cAIC4`'s `lm` branch).

The `s×s` numeric Hessian **B** of the (restricted) profile objective with respect to the

log-likelihood for ML, the REML criterion for REML) — the scale `cAIC4`'s `analytic = FALSE`
path consumes (`docs/math/0004` §1, §3). `s = length(m.θ)`. Dispatches on `source`:

- `:finitediff` — **self-driven** finite differences over `MixedModels`' *stable*
  `objective!`/`setθ!`/`updateL!` API (ADR-0002), **not** `MixedModelsFiniteDiffExt`.
  `objective!(m, θ)` mutates `m`, so `FiniteDiff` leaves it parked at its last probe; the
  driver restores θ̂ in a `finally` and **fails loud** if the restoration did not take — a
  Hessian computed against a silently-mutated fit is a defect (`docs/math/0004` §3b).
- `:forwarddiff` — rides the **experimental** `MixedModelsForwardDiffExt`
  (`ForwardDiff.hessian(m)`), the only B-source on experimental surface (ADR-0002). It
  differentiates a *frozen-σ* deviance, so it diverges from `:finitediff` by the σ-freezing
  of `docs/math/0004` §3a; the result type is shape-asserted against the `=5.5.1` pin.

The `s×s` result is shape-asserted: the experimental AD surface may change which parameters
are differentiated alongside θ, which would silently alter B's dimension — the assertion
turns that drift into a loud error against the pinned version.

    bootstrapglmmfit(m::GeneralizedLinearMixedModel{T}, y_star::Vector{T}) -> Vector{T}

Refit a deep copy of the GLMM `m` to the bootstrap response `y_star` (same design and
distribution family as `m`, variance parameters re-estimated from scratch via
`refit!`) and return the conditional fitted mean `μ* = g⁻¹(η*)` of the new fit. The
original model `m` is not mutated.

# Arguments
- `m`: the original fitted `GeneralizedLinearMixedModel`; supplies the design, link, and
  distribution.
- `y_star`: a bootstrap response vector of length `n = length(glmmresponse(m))`, on the
  same scale as `m.resp.y` (proportions for binomial-with-weights, counts for Poisson,
  etc.).

# Returns
- `Vector{T}` — the conditional fitted mean of the bootstrap fit.

# Throws
- `ArgumentError` if `length(y_star) ≠ n`.

    refitglmm_eta(m::GeneralizedLinearMixedModel{T}, y_new::Vector{T}) -> Vector{T}

Refit a deep copy of the GLMM `m` to the response `y_new` and return the linear
predictor `η̂` of the refitted model. The original model `m` is not mutated.

Used by the Poisson Chen–Stein refit loop (`DofGLMM.dof_glmm_poisson`): for each
nonzero observation `i`, the response is decremented (`yᵢ − 1`) and this function
returns the new `η̂` so the caller can extract the `i`-th component.

Distinct from [`bootstrapglmmfit`](@ref) which returns the fitted mean `μ̂`; the
Chen–Stein formula requires the link-scale `η̂`.

# Arguments
- `m`: the original fitted `GeneralizedLinearMixedModel`.
- `y_new`: new response vector, length `n = length(glmmresponse(m))`.

# Returns
- `Vector{T}` — the linear predictor `η̂ = Xβ̂ + Zb̂` of the refitted model.

# Throws
- `ArgumentError` if `length(y_new) ≠ n`.
